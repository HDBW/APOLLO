# Welcome to the Backend of Invite Project Apollo

The purpose of the backend is to serve the app users with the best possible results on courses and qualifications. However in order to do so, we believe the user needs to understand his environment and what is going on in thé market. This is why one aspect of apollo is to aquire as much information about the labor market as possible and share the learnings and findings with our users.
