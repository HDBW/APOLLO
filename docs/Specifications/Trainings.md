## Definitions

### Training Providers

### Organisations

### Training Providers
The apollo consortium consits of training providers represented by [bbw](https://www.bbw.de/startseite/), [biwe](https://www.biwe.de/) and [t√ºv rheinland academy](https://akademie.tuv.com/). They offer voccational trainings in the context of adult education for job seekers, employees and trainees etc. While the scope of this project mainly focuses on the personas as defined in the [personas](Personas/readme.md) document. This document focuses on the products of the training providers.

### Training or Course
A training or course is a document which is unstructured or structered by the corresponding learning management system of the training providers. The course schema or datapoints may vary from provider to provider or even from subject or training or related qualification. So there is no standard information for a particular training or course. **However invite project apollo defines a course or training as a product of the training providers offering the possibility to aquire skills and competencies needed for the job or next step in the career of a potential customer.** 

Therefor a training or course is a set of files or documents describing these products. 

### Purpose of the Training Data Structure
The purpose is to manage courses and trainings and evaluate their relevance. So basically a training consists of several documents and associated information. Therefor a training data structure is something different then the offered course or training itself. While the training description and target audiences as well as competencies aquired are a different process. The idea behind apollo is to identify needs of the market and the apollo audience and the training providers. Therefor documents describing aspects of the course wheter they are imported via the apollo graph api or via the user interface (backend) they typically have a lifecycle where they needed to be managed and maintained. Also courses need to be updated over time to be relevant for the audience. Therefor a management system which allows to import documents, extract necessary and relevant information and support the training providers in updating topics or modules of a course based on feedback from the participants and the labour market are the purpose of the apollo backend. 

In order to stay relevant information like labour market demands and regulatory changes need to be tracked. In order to give advice to the training providers and give the training providers the possiblity to reach out to the participants and/or interested users of courses and inform them about updates or changes. This is a hugh asset of the invite project apollo.
